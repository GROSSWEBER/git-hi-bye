# git-bye-hi

git aliases to quickly transfer the current branch between machines using private branches on the server.

## Installation

```sh
curl -sL https://git.io/git-bye-hi | sh -

# or
wget -nv -O - https://git.io/git-bye-hi | sh -
```

This will add two aliases `git bye`and `git hi` to your global `.gitconfig`.

## Usage

Run `git bye` to:

* Commit pending changes
  * All untracked and changed files will be added to the commit
  * The commit message will be generated automatically:
    `Commit on <HOSTNAME> at <current date and time>`
  * Commit hooks will not be run (`git commit --no-verify`)
* Force-push the current branch to your `origin` remote as a private branch named `refs/private/<your username>/<current branch name>`

Run `git hi` to:

* Fetch private branches (`refs/private/<your username>/*`) from your `origin` remote
* Update local branches from the private branches on the server
  * `refs/private/<your username>/master` will update your `master` branch
  * Only fast-forwards are allowed
  * New branches not available locally yet will be created

## Example

1. Make some changes to your working copy

  ```sh
  agross@AXL /scratch/workstation @master*
  $ git status
  On branch master
  Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
  Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

          modified:   123

  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
  ```

2. Save them on the server using `git bye`

  ```sh
  agross@AXL /scratch/workstation @master*
  $ git bye
  Saving branch master for user agross

3. Open a git shell on another machine and restore with `git hi`

  ```sh
  agross@AXL /scratch/laptop @master
  $ git log --oneline --decorate
  2c553f0 (HEAD -> master, origin/master, origin/HEAD) First commit

  agross@AXL /scratch/laptop @master
  $ git hi
